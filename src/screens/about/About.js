            Our goal is to instill the values of being an American-Muslim into
            our patrons and students. We offer several Islamic services
            including daily classes for children with a focus on learning how to
            read and memorize Quran.

            Students also learn the etiquettes of prayer, basic Islamic history,
            and Islamic values. Currently, 130 students attend classes on a
            regular basis.Â  Our recently launched Hifz memorization class,
            allowed students to assist in leading Taraweeh prayers.
